# BMW Integration Level (I-Level)

As cars are getting more and more complex, a way to keep track of software running on a car is needed.

BMW seems to develop software for the different units of the car. After changes in the diferent units, testing is performed with changes in many onboard computers. After testing, BMW releases bundles of software for all the units of a car tagged under an "Integration Level".

The integration level us a bundle of different software pieces that have been tested to work together.
