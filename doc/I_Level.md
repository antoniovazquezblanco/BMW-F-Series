# BMW Integration Level (I-Level)

As cars are getting more and more complex, a way to keep track of software running on a car is needed.

BMW seems to develop software for the different units of the car. After changes in the diferent units, testing is performed with changes in many onboard computers. After testing, BMW releases bundles of software for all the units of a car tagged under an "Integration Level".

The integration level us a bundle of different software pieces that have been tested to work together.

To change the I-Level of a car you need to flash the different units of the car with the corresponding new versions of the software. This can only be done connecting the car with a cable to the adecuate software, this cannot be done by downloading updates to an SD card.
