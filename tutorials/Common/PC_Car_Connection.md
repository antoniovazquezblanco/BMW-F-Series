# PC-Car Connection

This is a summary on how to physically connect your PC to your car.

First, locate where your car OBD II port may be placed. You can check out your _Owner's Handbook for Vehicle_ and search for the _OBD_ or _Socket for on-board diagnosis_ terms.
You can find more about how the port may look like in <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics#OBD-II_diagnostic_connector>.

## ENET

The ENET cable has two ends. One connects to the OBD II port in your car and the other one into an Ethernet port in your PC. If you are using a laptop without ethernet port you may consider purchasing an Ethernet USB adapter.
